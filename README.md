1- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle  
A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should only have one job.

2- OCP: Open-Closed Principle  
Software objects or entities (Class, modules, functions) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

3- LSP: Liskovâ€™s Substitution Principle  
A sub-class must be substitutable for its super-class

4- ISP: Interface Segregation Principle  
Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

5- DIP: Dependency Inversion Principle  
A high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
